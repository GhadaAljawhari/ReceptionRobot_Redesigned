# ReceptionRobot_Redesigned

This is a Reception Robot undergoing minor changes. It holds the tablet over its head instead of its chest to be more fun and welcoming. Its eyes are crystal red to give an interesting, Roboty- look.

*Note: Measutments must be checked according to users' needs.

*This project is a requirement to complete the Smart Methods summer training.
